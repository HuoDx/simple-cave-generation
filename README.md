A Cave Generation Experiment
===

This is a simple demo for showing how can cave biomes generated easily through an algorithm based on random numbers.

It's super simple: it iterates through the map twice: the first time determine whether the position is a stone block or not and for the second time it determines again based on whether it's 8 neighbors are stone blocks.
